# Learning React

This is a repository of all the work I am doing to teach myself the ReactJS library.  It includes the results of reading
books, documentation, and blogs.  It will consist of many simple examples as teach myself the building blocks of the
library.

Because Webstorm seemed to have memory issues, I moved all past launch school projects to the Documents directory.

More complicated examples and code will follow as I seek to integrate different features together.

The easier projects are as follows:
1.  Number Guessing Game - Event Driven And Asynchronous Programming Course
2.  Build An Input Box - Event Driven And Asynchronous Programming Course
3.  SearchAutoComplete - Making HTTP Requests From Javascript
4.  ArithmeticCalculator - Putting It Altogether Course
5.  GroceryList - Putting It Altogether Course
6.  GuessAWord - Putting It Altogether Course
7.  PhotoGallery - Putting It Altogether Course
